# CSS DEMO SITE

## Description:
**This project's goal was simply to make this web page more “accessible” without changing the layout and design, and because another developer previously created the code, refactoring the existing code was requested.**

## Tasks performed:

> Once my connection with GitHub was established, I successfully created a Repo and cloned it to my local computer using the Terminal.  I went through the HTML and immediately noticed a big pot of DIV soup; I removed the non-semantic elements and replaced them with HTML5/semantic elements, leaving a logical and more modern HTML structure.  There were a few errors in the code, like a Class that needed to be an ID and a link that wasn’t working; these issues were also resolved.  

> With the HTML cleaned up, I then viewed the web page in a browser, and the layout, not surprisingly, was broken.  This led me to the CSS file, where I removed the DIVs and replaced the Selectors with the respective (semantic) element names that were updated in the HTML file.  I also cleaned up the repeat code, consolidated multiple classes into single selectors, and confirmed that all URLs were correctly listed.  I then refreshed the web page in the browser, and voila, it rendered correctly. 

> I then returned to the Terminal and added my properly commented changes to GitHub Repository.  I then viewed the GitHub URL’s web page and confirmed it was rendering as intended.

> A good web developer makes their code easy to use and adheres to the best practice standards for web browsers and search engines; this creates a more visible website accessible to all.
